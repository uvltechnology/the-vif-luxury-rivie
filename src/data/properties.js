    shortDescription: 'Discover Villa Rocsea—where rugged coastal beauty meets sweeping Mediterranean panoramas. This four-bedroom sanctuary at 205 Chemin de Giram captures the very soul of elevated Riviera living, where ancient Roman heritage, breathtaking vistas, and contemporary luxury converge beneath the watchful gaze of the Trophée des Alpes.',
    fullDescription: `Villa Rocsea—named for the dramatic meeting of rock and sea that defines this spectacular location—stands as a beacon of refined living in La Turbie, one of the French Riviera's most spectacular and historically significant hilltop villages. Positioned at 205 Chemin de Giram at 450 meters above sea level, this magnificent four-bedroom villa offers more than breathtaking views; it offers a rare opportunity to inhabit the same dramatic landscape that has captivated Romans, artists, and aristocrats for over two millennia.

From the moment you arrive, Villa Rocsea reveals its magic. The villa's elevated position commands a sweeping 180-degree panorama that stretches from the glittering principality of Monaco to the distant Italian coastline, with the endless azure expanse of the Mediterranean unfolding like a sapphire canvas below. This is the view that inspired emperors—the same coastline that Roman legions admired from the nearby Trophée des Alpes, the ancient monument that still crowns La Turbie's summit.

The architecture of Villa Rocsea pays elegant homage to classic Provençal design while embracing every modern comfort. Sun-drenched interiors flow effortlessly through French doors onto multiple terraces, creating the seamless indoor-outdoor lifestyle that defines Riviera living at its finest. Natural stone, warm terracotta, and carefully curated furnishings create spaces that feel both timeless and utterly contemporary.

Inside, four generously proportioned bedrooms provide sanctuary for up to eight guests. The master suite upstairs features a luxurious en-suite bathroom and private terrace where morning espresso becomes a ritual against the backdrop of sunrise over the sea. Two additional bedrooms offer independent Italian showers and captivating garden or sea views, while a versatile fourth room adapts to your needs—be it additional sleeping quarters, a peaceful home office, or a children's playroom.

The heart of the villa is its expansive 60m² living and dining area, where a fully equipped modern kitchen invites culinary adventures with local market finds—ripe tomatoes from Menton, fresh herbs from the village, and wines from nearby Bellet vineyards. A traditional Provençal fireplace adds warmth and atmosphere for cooler evenings, creating the perfect gathering space for conversation and celebration.

Yet it is outdoors where Villa Rocsea truly reveals its soul. The swimming pool, designed with three varying depths, accommodates everyone from splashing children to adults seeking a refreshing swim after a day exploring coastal villages. Mature Mediterranean gardens—fragrant with lavender, rosemary, and century-old olive trees—provide shaded sanctuaries for afternoon reading or intimate conversations. The covered dining terrace, equipped with a premium gas BBQ and summer lounge furniture, becomes the stage for unforgettable meals where local wines taste richer and laughter carries on the breeze.

An adorable independent guest house with its own kitchenette can accommodate an additional four people, making Villa Rocsea ideal for extended families or groups of friends seeking both togetherness and privacy.

La Turbie itself enriches every moment of your stay. This medieval village sits majestically above Monaco along the spectacular Grand Corniche—the legendary cliff-edge road that ranks among the world's most scenic drives. The village center, just minutes by foot, offers authentic Provençal living: a bakery where fresh croissants emerge at dawn, a fromagerie with aged Comté and local chèvre, a weekly market bursting with regional produce, and family-run restaurants serving genuine Mediterranean cuisine.

The crowning jewel is the Trophée des Alpes, the monumental Roman trophy erected by Emperor Augustus in 6 BC to commemorate his conquest of the Alpine tribes. This 2,000-year-old monument towers above the village, a daily reminder that you're living in a landscape where history and natural beauty have intertwined for millennia.

From this privileged vantage point, the entire Côte d'Azur becomes your playground. Monaco's glamour lies just 10 minutes below. The medieval village of Èze, perched impossibly on its clifftop, is eight minutes away. Nice's vibrant markets, museums, and beaches await 20 minutes down the coast. The Italian border beckons 15 minutes to the east. And yet, after a day of exploration, returning to Villa Rocsea feels like coming home—to peace, to beauty, to the perfect harmony of rock and sea.

This is not merely a vacation rental. Villa Rocsea is your invitation to experience the French Riviera from its most spectacular perspective—elevated, dramatic, and utterly unforgettable. Here, where ancient stone meets endless Mediterranean blue, you'll discover why this coastline has captivated dreamers and wanderers for over two thousand years.`,

    shortDescription: 'Discover exceptional privacy and breathtaking panoramas at Villa Bellevue. Perched in the historic village of La Turbie, this three-bedroom sanctuary offers commanding views across Monaco, the Mediterranean, and the Italian coastline—where ancient Roman heritage meets contemporary Riviera luxury.',
    fullDescription: `Villa Bellevue stands as a masterpiece of location and design, nestled at 205 Chemin de Giram in the medieval hilltop village of La Turbie. This exceptional three-bedroom villa captures the very essence of elevated Riviera living, where sweeping vistas meet sophisticated comfort in one of the French Côte d'Azur's most prestigious addresses.

Positioned at 450 meters above sea level, the villa commands a breathtaking 180-degree panorama that stretches from the glittering principality of Monaco to the distant shores of Italy. Here, beneath the shadow of the ancient Roman monument Trophée des Alpes, you'll experience the Riviera from a perspective few discover—where eagles soar and the Mediterranean unfolds like a sapphire tapestry below.

Located in a private and wooded domain, this magnificent villa has been recently renovated with meticulous attention to detail. Step through the villa's entrance and immediately sense the harmony between architecture and landscape. Light-filled interiors flow seamlessly through French doors onto expansive terraces, where every vantage point frames nature's artistry. The thoughtfully appointed living spaces blend contemporary elegance with warm Mediterranean character—vaulted ceilings, natural stone accents, and curated furnishings that speak to both comfort and refined taste.

The master suite upstairs features a luxurious bathtub and private terrace offering stunning sea views—your personal sanctuary above the clouds. Two additional bedrooms each include independent Italian showers and garden or sea views, ensuring every guest enjoys privacy and comfort. A versatile TV room with shower can be converted into a fourth bedroom on request, making this villa perfect for larger gatherings.

The spacious 60m² living and dining area welcomes you with an all-equipped modern kitchen and charming fireplace, creating an inviting space for gathering and celebration. Outside, the villa truly reveals its magic. The large swimming pool features three different depths to accommodate all ages, from children splashing joyfully to adults swimming leisurely. Mature Mediterranean gardens—fragrant with lavender, rosemary, and century-old olive trees—provide shaded sanctuaries for afternoon reading or intimate conversations. The gas BBQ, summer lounge, and covered dining terrace become the stage for memorable meals, where local wines taste richer and conversations linger longer under the Provençal sun.

An adorable guest house with a small kitchen for 4 people can be booked additionally with the main property, perfect for extended families or friends seeking both togetherness and privacy.

La Turbie itself adds layers of enchantment to your stay. This small town is situated above the Monaco principality on the French Riviera, along the spectacular Grand Corniche road that runs from Nice to Monaco—one of the great scenic highlights of this region. The medieval village is beautifully preserved, and the great Roman monument, the Trophée des Alpes, dominates from its commanding position. For everyday life, you'll find everything you need in the village: restaurants, pharmacy, bakery, cheese, meat and grocery stores, hairdresser, and tourism office.

There are too many highlights in the region to list here, from magnificent scenery and traditional Provençal hilltop villages such as Èze to the glitzy resorts of the French Riviera like Roquebrune Cap Martin, Beaulieu sur Mer, Saint Jean Cap Ferrat and the wealthy principality of Monaco. Nice airport and Italy are also within a quarter hour drive from La Turbie. There is something close to La Turbie for everyone!

This is not merely a vacation rental. Villa Bellevue is your invitation to live as the Romans, artists, and aristocrats have for millennia—elevated above the everyday, immersed in beauty, and surrounded by the timeless allure of the French Riviera's most spectacular coastline.`,
